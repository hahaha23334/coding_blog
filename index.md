# Hi, I'm Ge! 👋

Welcome to my digital workspace. I'm a developer and aspiring Technical Artist focused on bridging the gap between code and creativity in the video game industry. 

This blog is where I document my learning journey, share coding tutorials, and break down game mechanics.

## 🛠️ What I'm Working On
Currently, I'm diving deep into **Unreal Engine 5**, **C++**, and **Computer Vision**. When I'm not writing code or building shaders, you can probably find me analyzing the systems behind my favorite RPGs.
